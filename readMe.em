the planMeshArr deicliration is {
    buffer: ArrayBuffer(48): This indicates that the Float32Array is backed by an ArrayBuffer object of 48 bytes. ArrayBuffers are used to store raw binary data.
    byteLength: 48: This confirms the size of the ArrayBuffer in bytes.
    byteOffset: 0: This specifies that the Float32Array starts at the beginning of the ArrayBuffer.
    length: 12: This reiterates that the Float32Array has a length of 12 elements.
    Symbol(Symbol.toStringTag): 'Float32Array': This is an internal symbol used by JavaScript to identify the object as a Float32Array.
}  and you have to use the array till the last 0 so its [-2.5, 2.5,0] and its use to define the Vertices
    x, y, z
